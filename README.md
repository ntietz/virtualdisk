virtualdisk
===========

This project used to be my thesis project. Near the end of summer 2012, I decided to drop my thesis and, consequently, development on virtualdisk halted.

This code is fairly broken in a few places, but it is a good demonstration of how to use Netty and a few other things, as well as an example of the kind of code I can write.
