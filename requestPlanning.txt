    ENCODING / DECODING SCHEME
=================================================

encode:
    message-type    (1 byte)
    message-length  (4 bytes - int)
    super-class's encoding
    encode members

decode:
    read message-type
    read message-length
    if enough-readable-bytes
        decode super-class's members
        decode members
    else
        reset buffer index
        wait for more input
